There are 3 POWERED SYSTEMS:

-   BATTLE STATIONS: this determines how quickly the cards are DISCARDED.
-   CHARGING: pushes power into CHARGE (a reservoir that rebuilds over time based on charging), which is released by BEAM and EXOTIC weapons to make them more powerful.
-   SHIELDS: pushes power into boosting SHIELDS.

There are 4 WEAPON TYPES: BEAM, CANNON, TORPEDO, and EXOTIC. All weapons can strike any RANGE or FACING, but tend to more effective in particular RANGES and/or FACINGS. Every TACTICAL SYSTEM (weapon, shield, repair, boarding, hacking, etc.) has 5 cards associated with it that form a desk. In addition, there are cards that the ship might have based on achievements, juryrigging, etc.

WEAPON TYPES have the following unique characteristics:

-   BEAM: Can be fired as many times as you like, but does more damage when charged.
-   CANNON: Puts all cannons on lockdown for some number of seconds.
-   TORPEDO: Consumes ORDINANCE.
-   EXOTIC: Does different effects, but consumes CHARGE.

Whenever an ENEMY card does something other than damage to your ship (an EFFECT, like draining power), then that card is the next one drawn by the OPERATOR (and takes effect when drawn).

The TACTICAL OPERATOR always has a hand of 5 cards. Every so often (determined by BATTLE STATIONS), a card will be DISCARDED and a new one drawn (which will typically be a helpful card from one of the TACTICAL SYSTEMS but can occationally be a NEGATIVE EFFECT as per above). The cards will be DISCARDED in order (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 2, ...). The OPERATOR can pause cards being DISCARDED via a button (and resume with the same button).

The SENSORS in your ship can track up to 5 targets. It will prioritize ships dealing damage to you. The SENSORS can be damaged and give less slots to track enemies. The sensors will show SHIELDS, HULL, ARMOR, EVASION, FACING (which arc you are firing from and which arc it will hit), RANGE, whether the RANGE is increasing or decreasing. You might have actual numbers or you might have "?" because the SENSORS have not scanned it yet.

ARMOR reduces damage. EVASION reduces chance to hit. HIT is the chance to hit. Plus look at Fleet.

The following visualizations need to be on the screen:

-   3 POWERED SYSTEMS
-   The current CHARGE
-   5 targets on SENSORS
-   Button to pause BATTLE STATIONS
-   5 cards
-   A zone to show incoming damage and effects
-   A zone beneath SENSORS to show outgoing damage and effects
-   Your SHIELDS
-   Your HULL
-   Your ORDINANCE
-   Your CREW
-   EVAC button
-   CANNON cooldown timer (or maybe even a colored meter)

Some example TALENTS:
